// Create a new .js file with the appropriate methods to help modify your source data to help render it to the DOM:
// Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects or source data.
// Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
// Use jQuery to clone the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.
// Your "Project" prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.
